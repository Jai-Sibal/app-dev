# Ghost Rider

The Ghost Rider's primary mission is to punish the wicked by unleashing a supernatural form of justice. The character is often depicted as an antihero, seeking revenge on those who commit heinous acts. Ghost Rider is known for his penance stare, a power that allows him to make his adversaries experience all the pain and suffering they have caused others.
